# STA_STIN
Spatio-temporal attention based neural network for route risk assessment

Implementation is torch 0.4.0

This data-driven model takes the dynamic graph as the inputs, and can assess the probability of future UAV being destroyed by reasoning relations and learning spatiotemporal feature differences. The neural network includes three parts: spatial attention module, temporal attention module and principal part based on STIN.
